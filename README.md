# DESCRIPTION
 
In my life and in my work I always try to plan ahead, test and implement. After implementation, always try to improve what I have done and obtain.
As an athlete, I need to train hard and get the best result in competition, and in my professional experience it's the same. Work hard every day,
improve what has been done and get to the finish line.
I'm passionate about OpenSource solutions. Investigate new technologies / solutions and try to get the best of them to the business.
I am very enthusiastic and committed to maintain quality and efficiency.
I like to commit myself to the things I do, instead of just being involved. When you love what you do, you give yourself entirely to it.
